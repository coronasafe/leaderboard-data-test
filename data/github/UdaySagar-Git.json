We could use any icon to represent replies if exist , and no icon if no replies exist\r\n- [ ]  keep the default view as the default, not the thread view\r\n\r\n---\r\nAttachments and mentions enhancements are planned after mid term\r\n\r\n- [ ]  the attached image or audio files are not been attached to the chat.\r\n- [ ]  you are reusing the voice recording component here, it doesnt go with the UI , think of a better UI\r\n- [ ]  when a invalid file type is upload, the chat space is not restore the state, it is still showing 100% uploaded all the time\r\n- [ ]  rather than showing invalid file type, mention more user friendly error message\r\n- [ ]  try to inspire the tagging mechanism from slack, when we type, the text is visible to the user, and based on each character input, the list keep on filtering\r\n- [ ]  change the cancel text for reply comment to a icon and the send icons giving a feel it doesn't suit there, for example the slack editor looks good for the icon positioning\r\n- [ ]  if a user was tagged in the note, they should be send a notification stating that he/she has been mentioned in this note.\r\n- [ ]  when you click on the tagged user name, you are been taken to a page not found space,"
